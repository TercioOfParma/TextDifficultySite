1) HttpResponseMessage won't return a stream, use IActionResult instead
2) Remember to reset the stream position to 0 when sending to a blazor download
3) Log(2)(x / y) = Score, x = 2^Score * y 

log(x) / log(y) = Score

log(x) = Score * log(y) (Base^log(y) = y)
4) Give more conscious thought to what data structures make sense
