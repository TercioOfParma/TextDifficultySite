# This is what I would like to have in a general release

- Output to HTML Table
- Output to Radzen DataGrid
Security:
    - API Keys for people wishing to use this as a service in another application
        - This would be charged per request and limited
- Limit number of files at one time to 10 of 100k words each 
- Give API functionality to load text into the Database without the frontend
- Donate Button
- Mock up and Implement Better UIs and Main Pages for both HTMX and Blazor 
- Fix Unknown Words to acknowledge repetitions in the file
- Add the Following Indicators of Difficulty:
    - Sentence Length 
    - How many words could be learnt on up to 4 passes through the text
        - These would be roughly tiered according to Gregory Kazakov's study (Under 1 million easy etc.)
    - Word Similarity (Remember that search algorithm that I used for the Phonebook?)
    - Uncommon Words (Perhaps all of those words that would otherwise take over a million words to acquire?)
- Load in the most commonly learnt words
- Full CRUD For Language Names



# Second Version if over 10000 views in the first month
- Hebrew/Arabic Script Support
- East Asian Language Support
- Option Groups for Different Uses and Registers of Language, or select Corpora (Vulgate, Street Slang etc.)
